A note on sources This work is heavily based on work by Tilak Kularatne
on the History of Printing in Ceylon. The primary sources of
correnspondance reffered by Kularatne was re evaluated and re
interprited in context of typography. Some of the reports and
correspondance of the missionaires are avialbel in various librries
across Europe, but due to the time restrictions the extracts of the
reposrts and correspondnce was used. In a future reserch using the
original material the original smaples of drawings might be uncoverd.
The typeforms in printed material are defromed and affected by the
printing conditions and the hige qulity images of types analysed and
presented here are best represntation of the letterforms.

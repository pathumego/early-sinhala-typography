# Milestones in the development of Sinhala typography in the 19th century

### A critical analysis of the cultural and social context of the development of Sinhala types and book typography in the 19th century



This study explores the key developments of Sinhala type and typography   in the 19th century with a primary focus on evolution in the early decades. Sinhala script was a monolinear, script with a long tradition of writing on palm-leafs. In the 18th century with the introduction of the movable type the adaptation of Sinhala script to composing with metal blocks started. This study contextualises the stylistic and technical decisions that formed the appearance of the Sinhala printed letterforms and typography, in the cultural, social and political background of the 19th century Ceylon. This study discusses the key developments such as introduction and evolution of stroke modulation and composition of typefaces and typographic developments of the period.

It is conclusive that the Western standards of typography influenced the style of missionary printing enterprises of this time, and this study attempts to identify the motives, challenges and the background which led to specific decisions. Sinhala types and typography of three key contributors; Dutch Press in Colombo; Serampore Mission Press in Serampore and The Wesleyan Methodist Mission Press in Colombo is analysed and presented. This study does not cover the period exhaustively, rather investigates the key entities, events and printed material that contributed to the milestones in the development of Sinhala typography of the period, in a cultural, political and technical framework.

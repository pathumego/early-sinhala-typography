			<p class="heading-1">   Abstract</p>
			<p class="Normal">This study explores the key developments of Sinhala type and typography in the 19th century with a primary focus on evolution in the early decades. Sinhala script was a monolinear, script with a long tradition of writing on palm-leafs. In the 18th century with the introduction of the movable type the adaptation of Sinhala script to composing with metal blocks started. This study contextualises the stylistic and technical decisions that formed the appearance of the Sinhala printed letterforms and typography, in the cultural, social and political background of the 19th century Ceylon. This study discusses the key developments such as introduction and evolution of stroke modulation and composition of typefaces and typographic developments of the period. </p>
			<p class="Normal">&#9;It is conclusive that the Western standards of typography influenced the style of missionary printing enterprises of this time, and this study attempts to identify the motives, challenges and the background which led to specific decisions. Sinhala types and typography of three key contributors; Dutch Press in Colombo; Serampore Mission Press in Serampore and The Wesleyan Methodist Mission Press in Colombo is analysed and presented. This study does not cover the period exhaustively, rather investigates the key entities, events and printed material that contributed to the milestones in the development of Sinhala typography of the period, in a cultural, political and technical framework. </p>

			<p class="Normal">This dissertation focuses on Sinhala</span><a href=""><span class="sidenote_reference _idGenCharOverride-1">1</span></a> typography and printed</span> letterforms in the early 19th century and the factors that</span> influenced the development of them. The transformation of Sinhala script</span> from letters written on a palm leaf to typographic letterforms</span> printed on paper with metal typesetting began in the 18th</span> century. However, traces of the current style of letterforms and</span> typography are first seen at the beginning of the 19th</span> century with the advent of Sinhala printing and publishing by</span> the British missionaries. Histories of printing and linguistics of Ceylon</span><a href=""><span class="sidenote_reference _idGenCharOverride-1">2</span></a> provide an insight into the development of the Sinhala </span>printing and language, and the influences of politics and socioeconomics. </span>Until now, how these circumstances affected the style of typography, </span>type making process and the letterforms has not been explored </span>in particular depth. &#9;</span></p>

Additionally, this document </span>seeks to systematically study the precise historical events and personalities </span>that influenced the type making process and the Sinhala types </span>of the period. While this study does not claim to </span>be conclusive, it covers a range of organisations, personalities, incidents, </span>and original printed material that are representative of the time </span>and the themes discussed.</span></p>
			<p class="Normal">&#9;This dissertation examines significant contributions by </span>three principal printing and type making operations; the Dutch Press </span>in Colombo; the Serampore Mission Press in Serampore, India; and </span>the Wesleyan Mission Press in Colombo. The most active and </span>influential missionary printing outfit of the time, Wesleyan Mission Press, </span>operated between the years of 1814 to 1878. The secondary </span>sources consulted build an understanding of the atmosphere of 19th </span>century colonial Ceylon and the context in which the developments </span>in typography and type making took place is based on </span>the consultation of primary sources including correspondence, reports and personals </span>accounts of involved parties. The imperfections of printing caused by </span>the circumstances of the time do not warrant a conclusive </span>analysis of the letterforms; rather this study attempt to analyse </span>the letterforms within the context of the research findings. </span></p>
			<p class="Normal">This </span>dissertation attempts to contextualise the early transitional years of Sinhala </span>typography and type, in relation to technology, culture and the </span>social conditions of the time. This study only concerns a </span>limited sample of  books from the time that corresponds to </span>historical events. An in depth analysis of wider range of </span>material could potentially uncover further insight into the period. Understanding </span>of the constraints and conditions that shaped the current Sinhala </span>letterforms opens up space for further studies in the evolution </span>of the Sinhala printed letter, and widens the possibilities for </span>Sinhala type design.</span></p>

			<p class="Normal">Sinhala is a native script to Sri Lanka and, used for writing Sinhala one of the two national languages of Sri Lanka. rooted in Brahmic script family. Sinhala is also used to write Buddhist literature in Pali and Sanskrit languages. Sinhala has gone through three main stages of development: linear, semi-linear and circular. Starting with early horizontal and vertical lines of the Brahmi script forms on the stone inscriptions. Semilinear forms of the script are represented in Sigiriya mirror wall inscriptions written in 8th – 10th century CE. With the Buddhist palm leaf manuscript tradition, the graphical forms of the Sinhala letters became more circular. A metal or wood stylus is used for writing on palm leaf and the letterforms were monolinear. Current Sinhala letterforms are dominantly formed with round smooth strokes. In general, the letterforms are wide and dense with complex strokes occurring inside the primary form. </p>
			<p class="Normal">&#9;It is an alpha syllabary with the consonants have an inherent vowel and absence of the inherent vowel is marked with Al-lakuna (commonly referred in Indic scripts as Virama ). Different vowel marks are combined to base consonant forming syllables. These marks are applied in different positions (above/below the consonant or before/after a consonant). Some combinations of consonant-vowel mark combinations form ligatures that are visually disconnected from the base characters. The composition of the language is explained in other studies </p>

			<p class="heading-1">7. Conclusion</span></p>
			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-2">The 19th century was a time of change in Ceylon</span>, </span>and the Sinhala script transformed into a rich typographic script by its conclusion</span>. </span>The British Missionaries were leading printers until the advent of commercial printing operations and the Buddhist Revival Movement</span>’</span>s printing in the 1860s</span>. </span>Wesleyan Methodist Mission Press in Colombo was the first amongst the equals of time and had a significant impact on the development of the document production in Sinhala</span>. </span>Missions</span>’ </span>work in printing and publishing set standards in language and grammar</span>, </span>Sinhala</span>-</span>Latin multiscript typography and modulation of Sinhala letterforms</span>. </span>Their contribution to the development of typography was influenced by the hostile and repressive attitude of colonists towards the natives and their culture</span>. </span></p>
			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-2">&#9;The increasing demand for new kinds of Sinhala written content and complex documents in the early 19th century introduced many reforms to the Sinhala language</span>. </span>The influence of palm</span>-</span>leaf manuscript styles seen in the early 18th</span>-</span>century Sinhala printed material diminished in the 19th century</span>, </span>and new standards were introduced</span>. </span>The Western typographic examples as well as other Indic script publications from Serampore  Mission Press influenced the work of the Weslyan Press. The shapes of the letterforms and stroke modulation had great variety and styles in the 19th century</span>, </span>but the modern Western</span>-</span>style influenced high contrast modulation introduced in the 1860s became the standard</span>. </span>The 1860s onwards there was a great increase in printing activities in Ceylon and all outlets adopted the styles and solutions developed by the Wesleyan Press</span>. </span>This was the dawn of commercial printing in Ceylon</span>  </span>and presses were attempting to emulate Wesleyan standards</span>.</span></p>
			<p class="Normal ParaOverride-2">&#9;It is conclusive that</span>, </span>the Western typographic standards and trends of the 19th century influenced the shape of Sinhala letterforms and the style of typography</span>. </span>Technical framework of the metal composition developed for Latin typography posed restriction when adapting the Sinhala script for printing</span>. </span>However</span>, </span>this influence is not an isolated incident of cultural invasion</span>, </span>but part of a wider series of social and economic adjustments that took place under British colonial rule and the evangelical missionary movement</span>. </span>Exploring the circumstances in which these historical models developed</span>, </span>and motives and agendas influenced the decisions made in this time</span>, </span>aids in developing a better evaluation criteria of typeforms engaging in further research in the visual development of Sinhala type and typography</span>.</span></p>
